# CookingX - Concept Documentation

**Overview**

I am aware of a similar plugin called BreweryX, and I would like to make something similar. Instead of Brewing it would bewith baking / cooking. My Sudo-Name for now would be CookingX. **CookingX would allow for ingredients grown from player's farms / gardens, and then made into a meal / dish through different processes of preperation.** There would be different work stations, and types of ways to make food. In a way it'd be similar to Bloxburg's food preperation / cooking system which this would be taking inspiration from.

## Planning Multiple Iterations

**This plugin would come in multiple different versions each progressing on the feature set.** For version 1.0 I would be coding up the basic cooking system and how different ingredients can be setup to make a dish.

Multiple versions ahead might contain things like custom crops, ways of creating menus etc. Mainly to allow the marketing of goods like these. Possibly adding **dedicated support for resturants**.

## Version 1

### **Custom workstations**
**General**

* Counter
    * Cutting Board
    * Mixing Bowl
    * Mortar & Pestle
    * Regular Counter

Appliance additions. Most of these like the Stove-top will be combined with something like a Oven.
* Stove Top
    * Varients
        * Gourmet
        * Quality
        * Household
        * Grill

        * Must have X amount of meat inside.

**Specialties**

* Coffee station

        * Brewery
        * Househeld
        * Temu Coffee maker

Now industrial varients will be pushed back to a later update since they will eventually have a multi-block build to have them.

### Deciding Recipes

Recipes:
* Soups
    * Soup recipes will be automatically decided after the soup is boiled, and based on the series of ingredients and prep'ed foods it will get a name.
* Sandwiches
    * Multiple ingredients stacked on a chopping board.
* Pizza
    * Combination of ingredients layered on a dough on a chopping board then slapped in the oven.
* Salads
* Combination of chopped goods in a bowl.
* More foods I gotta think :shrug:

Drinks:
* Smoothies
    * Blended assorted fruits & vegis

    * -.- coffee maker
* Juices
    * Filtered blended fruit & vegis
* Sodas
    * Planned for the future maybe ver 1.0?

### Cooking levels
Basic 1-3 step recipes are availiable to any player, but for increasingly long recipes it will require a higher cooking recipe.
